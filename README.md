# Predict_Health_Cost_DNN

Creating a DNN model to predict health care cost using the given dataset.
For this model:
1. I used label encoding to convert the categorical columns.
2. I also used a normalization layer to preprocess the incoming data
3. The model comprises of 3 ```Dense``` layer with ```relu``` as activation function.
4. I used ```Adam``` as the choice of optimizer.

Finally, after fitting the model I printed the mean absolute error and plotted the predictions.
